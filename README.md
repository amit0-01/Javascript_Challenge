Chemical Information Table
This project displays a dynamic, sortable table that lists chemicals along with relevant data like vendor information, density, viscosity, packaging, and more. Users can highlight, edit, and delete rows, as well as move rows up and down within the table. The table data is fetched from a JSON file, and the project features real-time sorting, row manipulation, and inline editing.
